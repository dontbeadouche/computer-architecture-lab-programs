1. Assuming the following data declarations:
fnum1: .float 6.28318
fnum2: .float 3.14159
fans1: .float 0.0
fans2: .float 0.0
dnum1: .double 42.3
dnum2: .double 73.6
dans1: .double 0.0
dans2: .double 0.0
Perform, the basic operations of:
fans1 = fnum1 + fnum2
fans2 = fnum1 * fnum2
dans1 = dnum1 - dnum2
dans2 = dnum1 / dnum2
2. Compute the average of a list of elements stored in memory
3. Compute the CGPA of a student in 5 subjects
